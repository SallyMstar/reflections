When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     A remote repository is helpful if the files may be accessed from multiple computers
     or by multiple contributors.  It can also serve as a back-up of your files in case
     files are lost on your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Some changes may not be ready for implementation or they may over-write
     what you're currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
     Forks are a copy of a repository which gives credit to the source, but doesn't allow
     3rd party changes to the original code.
     Clones are an exact copy of a repository; no credit is given.
     Branches are modifications to a repository that can be updated to the master.
When would you use one instead of another?
     Fork - to build on another's work.
     Clone - to share work.
     Branch - collaborative or experimental work.
