When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     A remote repository is helpful if the files may be accessed from multiple computers
     or by multiple contributors.  It can also serve as a back-up of your files in case
     files are lost on your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Some changes may not be ready for implementation or they may over-write
     what you're currently working on.
